For decades, we’ve been told that positive thinking is the key to a happy, rich life. \"F**k positivity,\" Mark Manson says. \"Let’s be honest, shit is f**ked and we have to live with it.\" In his wildly popular Internet blog, Manson doesn’t sugarcoat or equivocate. He tells it like it is—a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking today. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is his antidote to the coddling, let’s-all-feel-good mindset that has infected American society and spoiled a generation, rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up. Manson makes the argument, backed both by academic research and well-timed poop jokes, that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade, but on learning to stomach lemons better. Human beings are flawed and limited—\"not everybody can be extraordinary, there are winners and losers in society, and some of it is not fair or your fault.\" Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them. Once we embrace our fears, faults, and uncertainties, once we stop running and avoiding and start confronting painful truths, we can begin to find the courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility, curiosity, and forgiveness we seek. There are only so many things we can give a f**k about so we need to figure out which ones really matter, Manson makes clear. While money is nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true wealth is about experience. A much-needed grab-you-by-the-shoulders-and-look-you-in-the-eye moment of real-talk, filled with entertaining stories and profane, ruthless humor, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is a refreshing slap for a generation to help them lead contented, grounded lives.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780062457738"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"006245773X"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":224,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Self-Help"],"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":17,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"1.22.26.0.preview.2","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yng_CwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yng_CwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.co.in/books?id=yng_CwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Subtle+Art+of+Not+Giving+a+F*ck&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yng_CwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yng_CwAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"IN","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":955.06,"currencyCode":"INR"},"retailPrice":{"amount":477.53,"currencyCode":"INR"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yng_CwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-yng_CwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":955060000,"currencyCode":"INR"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":477530000,"currencyCode":"INR"}}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"IN","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Subtle_Art_of_Not_Giving_a_F_ck-sample-epub.acsm?id=yng_CwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=yng_CwAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"He now brings his hard-fought wisdom to this groundbreaking book."}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"gh2GxQEACAAJ","etag":"6y9uuJmtb68","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/gh2GxQEACAAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"Summary","subtitle":"The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life","authors":["Publishing Readtrepreneur"],"publishedDate":"2019-02","description":"The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F**k: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living A Good Life by Mark Manson Book Summary Readtrepreneur (Disclaimer: This is NOT the original book.

To help him accomplish all of these goals, he built a system that allowed him to complete quests, take on boss battles, earn experience points, and literally level up his life. If you have always dreamed of adventure and growth but can’t seem to leave your hobbit-hole, Level Up Your Life is for you. Kamb will teach you exactly how to use your favorite video games, books, and movies as inspiration for adventure rather than an escape from the grind of everyday life. Hundreds of thousands of everyday Joes and Jills have joined Steve’s Rebellion through his popular website, NerdFitness.com, and leveled up their lives—losing weight, getting stronger, and living better. In Level Up Your Life, you’ll meet more than a dozen of these members of The Rebellion: men and women, young and old, single and married, from all walks of life who have created superhero versions of themselves to live adventurously and happily. Within this guide, you’ll follow in their footsteps and learn exactly how to: • Create your own “Alter Ego” with real-life super powers • Build your own Epic Quest List, broken into categories and difficulty levels • Hack your productivity habits to start making progress • Train your body for any adventure • Build in rewards and accountability that will actually motivate you to succeed • Travel the world freely (and cheaply) • Recruit the right allies to your side and find powerful mentors for guidance Adventure is out there, and the world needs more heroes.

Are you tired of feeling fu*ked up? If you are, Gary John Bishop has the answer. In this straightforward handbook, he gives you the tools and advice you need to demolish the slag weighing you down and become the truly unfu*ked version of yourself. ''Wake up to the miracle you are,'' he directs. ''Here's what you've forgotten: You're a fu*king miracle of being.'' It isn't other people that are standing in your way, it isn't even your circumstances that are blocking your ability to thrive, it's yourself and the negative self-talk you keep telling yourself. In Unfu*k Yourself, Bishop leads you through a series of seven assertions: I am willing. I am wired to win. I got this. I embrace the uncertainty. I am not my thoughts; I am what I do. I am relentless. I expect nothing and accept everything.

Mark brings the same approach to teaching men what they need to know about attracting women. In Models he shows us how much it sucks trying to attract women using the tricks and tactics recommended by other books. Instead, he says, men need to focus on seduction as an emotional process not a physical or social one. What matters is the intention, the motivation, the authenticity. To improve your dating life you must improve your emotional life - how you feel about yourself and how you express yourself to others.
